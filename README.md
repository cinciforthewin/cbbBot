# cbbBot
Automatically creates game threads for r/CollegeBasketball.

Overview of files:
- `cbbBot.py`: The actual bot. Logs into Reddit, checks messages, submits threads.
- `cbbBot_edit.py`: Edits game threads. Separated into own script so that rate limits in regards to editing do not affect posting of threads.
- `cbbBot_data.py`: Contains various functions used by cbbBot. Gets r/CollegeBasketball ranking, gets game info from ESPN, and matches different names for the same team.
- `cbbBot_text.py`: Builds the markdown threads and title given the data.
- `cbbBot_newday.py`: Automatically schedules Top 25 games for the day.

- `cbbBot_get_teams.py`: Basic script to collect ESPN team names, generally used at the start of the season to update the team list.
- `data/team_list.txt`: CSV of teams with their ESPN team name, the corresponding logo flair, and the team name for cbbpoll.com.
- `data/games_to_write.txt` and `data/games_over.txt`: Files that keep track of the games that the bot will create threads for, and keep track of which games are over and no longer need to be edited, respectively.
- `data/blacklist.txt`: List of games for which games threads will not be made, as requested by select "blacklister."

Thanks to ELepolt for adding a team box score to the threads.
